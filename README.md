# Everyrealm SWE Task  

+ The app will be deployed on Vercel for convenience and the link will be added here.  

+ I used client side data fetching with react-query because of the following reasons;
    - the assumption that data entegrity is critically important(medium vs high vs critical).    
    - data integrity is maintained at the highest level to avoid stale data.  
    - no requirement for SEO specified in the instructions.  
    - the data amount is not specified in the instructions, making it difficult to determine SSG would cause ridiculous build times or not.    
    - possible to expand with limited fetching + infinite scrolling or pagination to balance performance and UX.
